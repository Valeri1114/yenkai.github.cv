					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
                    <p>My name is Yen Kai Chien, and I have diverse work experience across several industries, including luxury Swiss watchmaking, real estate sales, production line management, and primary industries. I graduated from National Chengchi University with a degree in Political Science and have a deep interest and passion for Taiwan's proud food industry. I hope to bring my interdisciplinary experience and knowledge to your company and promote Taiwanese food culture globally.

                        In my previous roles, I excelled in expanding client outreach and communication in unfamiliar territories, as well as optimizing production workflows to enhance productivity. I thrive on exploring uncharted territories and creating new opportunities and successes.
                        
                        I take pride in my ability to learn quickly and pursue new technologies, applying them effectively in practical work settings. I enjoy collaborating with teams to achieve shared goals and am eager to face new challenges and opportunities.
                        
                        I am deeply passionate about Taiwan's food industry and am excited about the prospect of contributing my skills and abilities to your company, while continuously learning and growing to meet future challenges.
                        
                        I look forward to the opportunity to discuss further. Thank you for considering my application.</p>
